## JavaScript - Data Types and TDD - Week 2 assignment 1

### What I did

For this assignment, we were given a bunch of empty functions that were not passing and needed to write the JavaScript code to make them pass. We learned how to use the principles of test driven development and how to start and run a basic web server via node.

The original description is below.



## JavaScript - Data Types and TDD

### Description

Today we covered an introduction to the basics of JavaScript. We talked about variables, and about primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans, and `undefined`). We talked about operators. We talked about control flow - code blocks, `if` and `else`, and `for` and `while` loops.

We've also spent some time talking about test-driven development, and the kinds of tools that let us make use of it.

This assignment will serve as an introduction to both.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the basics of JavaScript variables and primitive types
* Understand the basics of JavaScript operators and control flow
* Understand a very simple test-driven development workflow

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* Basic JavaScript
* Advanced TDD tools: Mocha and Chai
* node.js and Express, to start and run a web server

## Details

This assignment consists of a simple test runner that's performing a whole of tests on reasonably straightforward operations.

## Normal Mode

Replace the `_BLANK_` variables with the appropriate values in `public/index.js` and `public/test/test.index.js`. So if a line consists of:

```js
expect(2 + 2).to.equal(_BLANK_);
```

You should replace it with:

```js
expect(2 + 2).to.equal(4);
```

All tests must be passing when you reload the page.

## Hard Mode

Write some of your own passing tests for each section.
